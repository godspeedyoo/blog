Looking back, it's hard to believe that just a year ago, I was doing code exercises and learning about basic concepts such as the CSS box model, version control with git, and nested loops. Tomorrow, I start my first day as a fullstack developer with Dot & Bo. It's easy to think about the steps I took for a successful career change, but I was so focused on my growth as a web developer that I hardly had any time to reflect on what I was actually doing: starting a new life. Yes, I've heard of San Francisco, and yes, I've heard of silicon valley, but I simply had no clue what I was in for. Making the move over here has been a catalyst for yet another period of personal growth and change.

Every now and then, I look back to reflect on how I've changed. I'm particularly excited this time around because I feel there has been some very significant changes that can change the entire outlook of my future. I don't want to talk about specific changes in my habits, lifestyle, hobbies, or friends. While I'm extremely grateful for these, I'm most excited about what is responsible - changes in values. These are things that affect the core of who I am, and how I see myself. 

One of the most important ideas I've adopted has been to focus on being present and being in the moment. We spend so much of our day lost in thought or distracted. Giving myself small mental nudges throughout the day allows me to kick back into the moment and really enjoy whatever I am doing. This allows me to find joy in even the smallest things. Until now, I've never really sat down and simply appreciated just how awesome it feels to be alive. This change in attitude has led me to all kinds of new friends and experiences, while helping me let go of anxieties and fears that would otherwise prevent me from living my life to the fullest. 

Now there's something to think about. Living life to the fullest? Honestly, I can't yet say I know exactly what that means, but somehow I think I've taken several steps closer in that direction.
